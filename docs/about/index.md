#### Research

In my research, I examine processes that drive population dynamics, structure communities and mediate biological diversity across scales. I am broadly interested in understanding the determinants of species distribution and community dynamics in human-dominated landscapes and how human activities impact diversity and ecosystem functionning.

Keywords: community and population ecology, plant-insect interactions, ecosystem services, spatial modelling.

Research Area: Conservation biology, biogeography
